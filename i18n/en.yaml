    <p class="lead">
     "I'm a self-proclaimed 'jack of all trades, master of none' developer, perpetually juggling a variety of languages and frameworks ‚Äì from Android with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to backend systems with Golang, Firebase, and Google Cloud. I've even dabbled in AI, building and deploying a few production-grade applications, including a recommendation system and an internal knowledge base.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I'm a bit of an introvert, happiest when surrounded by my code and a handful of close friends (and maybe my guitar). Speaking of which, I've been trying to learn guitar for the past decade (and violin and harmonica!), but sadly, the violin had to go ‚Äì I simply wasn't playing it enough . I remain optimistic that I'll finally master at least one of them before I kick the bucket.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Beyond the code, I enjoy getting lost in a good book, twisting the Rubik's Cube into submission, and (occasionally) teasing my wife. üòâ
