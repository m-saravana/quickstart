### From Developer to Lead developer

In my current role as Lead Engineer at Trimble, I've led the team developing android apps and its backend using google cloud called Driver Workflow. Prior to my formal promotion to Lead Engineer, I effectively led the same team for over a year.

A significant highlight of my tenure has been my successful foray into AI development for the above app. I led the implementation of recomendation system (using Custom Entity Extraction) for the users using AutoML and Gemini AI and developed a Local Knowledge base using Ollama and RAG from internal feature and technical documentation.

During this time, I also successfully obtained the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification, further validating my expertise in cloud technologies and demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning.
