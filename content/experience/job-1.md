### From Developer to Lead developer

In my current role as Lead Engineer at Trimble, I've led the development of Android applications and their accompanying backend systems utilizing Firebase, Google Cloud and Golang. Prior to my formal promotion to Lead Engineer, I effectively led the same team for over a year.

A significant highlight of my tenure has been my successful foray into AI development. I led the implementation of a recommendation system for users, leveraging NLP and Custom Entity Extraction.

Furthermore, I played a key role in enhancing system reliability and performance. I implemented proactive monitoring dashboards using Datadog Logs and Metrics, significantly reducing customer complaints. I also maintained a robust backend system that efficiently processed millions of IoT messages per hour from legacy systems.
